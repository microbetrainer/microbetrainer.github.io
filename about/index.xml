      <description>What I do Shortly after graduating with my PhD from MIT, I took off to Tokyo, Japan thanks to a fellowship from the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science. I am now working in the lab of Kenya Honda on a couple of projects to discern the molecular bases for protective effects of bacteria on their hosts. Now, and during my PhD, I focus on a few main questions:</description>

      <description>Microbial Ecology Thinking on the scale of microorganisms can be really challenging as a macroorganism. While the intuition and approaches developed for macroecology may have relevance in microbial ecosytems, in many ways, I think it is misleading to think about microbial ecology as a miniature version of macrobial ecology.
Undergraduate education in bioprocess engineering emphasizes scaling up bench-scale technologies to industrial scale fermentations. Unfortunately, scale-up is a nontrivial process, particularly for cell culture, as behaviors and physiology of cells at the lab scale often completely change in &amp;gt;1000 L reactors.</description>
